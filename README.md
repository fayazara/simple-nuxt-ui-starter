# A simple Nuxt UI Pro Starter

This is a very simple barebones Nuxt UI Pro starter with the things I use most in my projects.

- Nuxt UI Pro
- Nuxt fonts
- VueUse
- TailwindCSS
- Nuxt SEO 
- Nuxt Content

## How is this different from the Nuxt UI Pro template?

- I wanted a separate landing page instead of the putting it in the docs markdown. I wanted to keep them separately.
- Bot Docs and Blog are included.
- 


Look at [Nuxt docs](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) and [Nuxt UI docs](https://ui.nuxt.com) to learn more.
