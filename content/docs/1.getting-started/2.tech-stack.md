---

SuperSaaS is built with a focus on simplicity and speed. The stack is kept lean, with reliable libraries and smart defaults — no hacks, no over-engineering.

Everything is designed to give you a clean starting point while staying feature-rich and production-ready.

---

### Nuxt

SuperSaaS runs on [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com), fully compatible with Nuxt 4. It's a powerful framework built on Vue that helps you ship SaaS apps quickly.

- **Zero Config** – TypeScript and JavaScript support out of the box
- **Auto Imports** – Components, composables, and utilities are auto-imported
- **Flexible Rendering** – Mix of static (landing pages) and SSR (dashboard) in Supersaas
- **Great DX** – Rich ecosystem of composables for rapid development
- **Built-in State** – Lightweight state management via `useState`
- **Universal Deployment** – Deploy anywhere: Cloudflare, Node.js, etc.

---

### Nuxt UI v3

An official UI kit made by the Nuxt team using Tailwind CSS, Reka UI, and Lucide icons.

- **Nice by Default** – Clean, modern UI out of the box
- **Fully Customizable** – Powered by the `ui` prop for deep customization
- **Lucide Icons** – Icon set included
- **Accessible** – Uses Reka UI for built-in accessibility

---

### Drizzle ORM

A type-safe ORM built for SQL and TypeScript. Lightweight, fast, and easy to use.

- **Type-Safe** – Strong typings for schema and queries
- **SQL-Like Queries** – Write SQL-style queries in TypeScript
- **Migrations** – Built-in migration support with Drizzle Kit
- **Multi-DB Support** – Works with Postgres, SQLite, MySQL, and D1  
  _(SuperSaaS includes examples for SQLite, Postgres, and Cloudflare D1)_

---

### Nuxt Auth Utils

A tiny auth layer for Nuxt that gives you just the right primitives to build your own auth flows.

- **Built for Nuxt** – Sealed cookie sessions using H3
- **Social Auth** – 35+ providers supported
- **WebAuthn** – Passkey support (Face ID, Touch ID, etc.)
- **Useful Composables**:

```ts
const { loggedIn, user, session, fetch, clear, openInPopup } = useUserSession();
```

### Tailwind CSS v4

- The default styling system used across the project. Fast, responsive, and works great with Nuxt.
- Utility-first and fully customizable
- Plays well with Nuxt UI v3 and Reka UI
- Works out of the box with no extra setup
