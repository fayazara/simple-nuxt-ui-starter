## Everything You Need to Build a Modern SaaS

Supersaas gives you everything out of the box to build, ship, and scale a full-featured SaaS product. From auth to payments to admin tools, it's all wired and ready to go.

#### Built with modern tools you actually want to use
Supersaas uses Nuxt 4, Vue 3, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, and Tailwind CSS -  a carefully thought out stack that's fast to build with and easy to maintain. Whether you're deploying to Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, Deno, Bun, or Node, it just works.

#### Complete Auth System, Done Right

You get email/password, magic links, OTP, social logins, phone number login, and even passkey (WebAuthn) support. Built-in session management and user handling means you can skip the boilerplate and focus on your app.

#### Type-Safe, Flexible Database Layer

Supersaas uses Drizzle ORM for fully type-safe database queries. Works with NuxtHub, Postgres, SQLite, and Turso. You choose what fits your use case best.

#### Production-Ready Payments

Stripe integration is included with working subscription flows and webhook handling. You can manage plans, sync products, and get going instantly. 

Polar, LemonSqueezy, and Paddle support are coming soon.

#### One API for All Your Emails
Use Resend, Zoho, Sendgrid, Postmark, or Mailgun — Supersaas wraps them in one simple API. Email templates are built using Vue Email and render beautifully across all clients.

FYI, I made a open source email library called [useEmail](https://github.com/SupersaasHQ/useEmail) that you can use to send emails in your app.

#### Fully-Featured Admin Panel
Supersaas includes a Super Admin dashboard where you can manage users, monitor Stripe products, view feedback, and more — no need to build this from scratch.

#### Clean UI with Nuxt UI
Built-in component system powered by Nuxt UI and Tailwind. Includes ready-to-use layouts, modals, alerts, forms, and dark mode. Lucide icons integrated.

#### Developer-first DX
- TypeScript-first - from Database schema, to API routes, to UI components and utils.
- ESLint + Prettier for consistent code
- Git hooks for formatting
- Easy-to-edit `.env` and config structure
- Clear file-based routing and modular structure
